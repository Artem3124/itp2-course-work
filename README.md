## Case study 3: Audio visualiser

In this case study I completed a simple music visualisation
program that contains five separate visualisations.

To turn the sound into something that can be visualised p5.js provides
a Fast Fourier Transform object. Take a look at its description in the
[p5.sound documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT).
