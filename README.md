## Case study 3: Audio visualiser

In this case study I completed a simple music visualisation
program that contains five separate visualisations.

To turn the sound into something that can be visualised p5.js provides
a Fast Fourier Transform object. Take a look at its description in the
[p5.sound documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT).

### How to run

Fork this repo, and run *index.html* with live server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

### P.S.:
Yeah, I know that OOP paradigm contradicts basic JS idea of Functional and Prototype inherited paradigm. I cannot justify myself on that matter. Therefore I'm opened to be shamed
